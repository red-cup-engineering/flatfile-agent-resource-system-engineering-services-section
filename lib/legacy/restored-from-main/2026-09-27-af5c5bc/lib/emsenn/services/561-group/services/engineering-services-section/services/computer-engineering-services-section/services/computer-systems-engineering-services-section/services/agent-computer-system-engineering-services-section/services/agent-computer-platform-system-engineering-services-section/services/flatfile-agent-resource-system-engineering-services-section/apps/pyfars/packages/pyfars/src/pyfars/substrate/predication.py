"""A typed graph edge between notes.

Sourced from either a frontmatter relation key (``source='fm'``, with ``kind``
naming the predicate — depends-on, see-also, ...) or a body markdown link
(``source='body'``, ``kind='link'``). The destination is the raw target as
written; resolution to a real note is the consumer's job.
