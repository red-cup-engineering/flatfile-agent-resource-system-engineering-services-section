"""Walk a frontmatter relation key into a chain of notes.

For each step, read ``fm[key]`` as a slug, look it up in ``lookup``, and
recurse. Cycles cut off; missing targets stop the walk. Returns
``[start, parent, grandparent, ...]``.

Default ``key`` is ``component-of`` — the corpus's hierarchical
relation between domain ``_index.md`` files (and many individual
notes). Pass ``key='specializes'`` for the rarer per-note relation,
or any other string-valued frontmatter key that points at a slug.

``lookup`` is typically ``index.by_domain`` (when chaining domain
hierarchy) or ``index.by_slug`` (when chaining note-level relations).
