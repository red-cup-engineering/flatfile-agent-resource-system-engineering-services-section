"""Classify a question's ``explores:`` entities by their firmness.

Returns a dict with four buckets:
  - ``firm``:    list of slugs that are proved theorems or characterized anchors.
  - ``sketch``:  list of ``(slug, status)`` tuples for theorem-likes that aren't proved.
  - ``loose``:   list of slugs for anchors with no characterizing theorems.
  - ``missing``: list of slugs for explored entities with no note in the corpus.
