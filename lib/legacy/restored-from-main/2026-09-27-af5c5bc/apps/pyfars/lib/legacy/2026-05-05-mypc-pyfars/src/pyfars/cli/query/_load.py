"""Shared loading + indexing for query subcommands.

Thin wrapper over ``pyfars.substrate.store.Substrate`` — the only thing query
needs that the standard scaffold doesn't is the ``include_triage``
escape hatch (the ``triage-cands`` subcommand specifically wants to see
draft content). Everything else (notes, by_slug, by_domain, edges,
in_edges, out_edges, claims) is already a cached_property on Substrate.

``QueryContext`` is kept as a name alias so existing subcommand
signatures stay stable; it's literally ``Substrate``.
