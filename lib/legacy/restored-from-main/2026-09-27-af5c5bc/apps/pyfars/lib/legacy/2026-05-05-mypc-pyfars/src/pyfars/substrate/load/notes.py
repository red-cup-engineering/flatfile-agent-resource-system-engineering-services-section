"""Walk a directory tree, load every markdown file with frontmatter as a ``Flatfile``.

Returns ``(notes, diagnostics)``. Files without frontmatter are skipped
silently. Files with a frontmatter block but malformed YAML, or that fail
to read at all, become Diagnostics and are skipped. Multiple notes may
share the same slug — that's normal across the repo and is the consumer's
problem, not the loader's; build ``index.by_slug`` if you need a slug view.

``path_filter`` defaults to the standard skip set (``.git``, ``node_modules``,
vendored markers, ``README.md``); pass a custom callable to widen or narrow.
