"""Relocation operators — move/rename without changing predication content.

Relocation is the FARS-side category for operators that *restructure*
the substrate without inserting or retracting predications: moving a
flatfile (with inbound-reference rewriting), renaming a frontmatter
key, rewriting body links.

Each function emits a ``Witness`` for its primary target. Operations
that rewrite inbound references (``move_flatfile``) emit ONE witness
for the move itself; the rewrite-summary is recorded in the witness's
``details`` rather than as separate witnesses (the witness chain stays
auditable and the multi-file rewrite is grouped as one logical
operation).
