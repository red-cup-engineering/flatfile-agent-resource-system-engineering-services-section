"""Move/rename a note and rewrite every inbound reference.

Moves the file, then for every inbound:
  - **fm references**: rewrite the slug value in the citing note's
    frontmatter (using ``rewrite_fm_slug``).
  - **body links**: replace ``[text](old_target_raw)`` with
    ``[text](new_target_raw)`` in the citing note's body.

When the slug doesn't change (only the path moves), body links are
still updated because their target paths shift. When the slug changes
but the parent dir is the same, fm refs change and body links keyed by
``slug.md`` change too.

Returns a dict summarizing what was changed: ``{"fm": N, "body": N,
"moved": True}``.
