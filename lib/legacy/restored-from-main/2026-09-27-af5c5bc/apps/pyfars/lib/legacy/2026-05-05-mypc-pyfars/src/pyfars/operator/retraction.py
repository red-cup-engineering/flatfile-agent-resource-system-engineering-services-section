"""Retraction operators — remove a predication from the substrate.

Retraction is the FARS-side category for operators that *remove*
content. Each function:
  1. Reads the target and computes its before-hash.
  2. Applies a pure transformation (using ``pyfars.operator.edit.fm_rm``
     and friends).
  3. Writes back (or deletes) and computes the after-hash.
  4. Returns a ``Witness``.
