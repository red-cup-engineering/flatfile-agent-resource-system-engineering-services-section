"""Rank library term notes by combined quality signals.

    score = inbound × desc × sourced × cited × structured × rubric ×
            density × clean_outbound × no_slop

Each factor is in [0, 1] except ``inbound`` (the volume multiplier).
The product collapses to zero whenever any signal is absent — a strict
"good across every dimension" threshold.
